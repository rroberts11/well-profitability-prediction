## About
This project aims to identify the most profitable oil wells across three different regions using data analysis, regression modeling, and performance evaluation. By predicting oil production levels from geological features, the project helps optimize drilling decisions and minimize investment risks.

## Problem Solved
This project tackles the challenge of evaluating oil well locations based on predicted profitability. With drilling operations being highly resource-intensive, accurate forecasting can guide exploration efforts and reduce financial risk. It enables stakeholders to allocate capital efficiently by comparing predicted outputs across regions.

## Key Technologies
pandas: For loading, exploring, and transforming datasets

numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulation

matplotlib / seaborn: For visualization of trends and distributions

scikit-learn: For building and tuning regression models

Jupyter Notebook: For experimentation and iterative development

## Features
Loads and cleans oil well data from three regions

Visualizes data distributions and geological features

Uses Linear Regression for production prediction

Applies RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization

Compares model performance across regions using RMSE

Recommends the most cost-effective region for investment

## Technologies
This project is built with:

Python 3.10+: Primary programming language

pandas: For tabular data handling

NumPy: For efficient numerical computing

Matplotlib / Seaborn: For plotting and visual exploration

scikit-learn: For machine learning modeling and evaluation
